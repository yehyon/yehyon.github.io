        <p>
          Following the 2016 election, a huge number of engineers and technologists have expressed interest in using their skills to make a difference. While those intentions are good, many people don't have an outlet. Other groups have organized hackathons for social good, civic tech, and politics, but these hackathons have a critical flaw: the products don't live beyond the weekend. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Pontifex Project is building a hackathon that gives participants all the resources they need to bring their products into production. And because most civic tech products aren't viable businesses on their own, we're sourcing teams from and pairing teams with corporations and nonprofits that can provide support. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Projects built at a Pontifex Project hackathon should aim to be non-partisan and usable by as many communities as possible. They are also required to be open sourced, -- by staying open source, your product can find more collaborators, be forked by people with similar missions, and has a better chance of making a lasting impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pontifex Project's first NYC hackathon is aiming to have 20 teams of 4-6 people. All teams are required to submit an application, and ideas will be made available for comments and feedback to the public. Sign up for our mailing list to be notified when the application is available!

            <h5 class="question">Why are applications required?</h5>
            <p class="answer">
              First off, we want to make sure that as many of the projects from the hackathon as possible continue on beyond the weekend; having an application allows us to try to select teams that are passionate enough to follow through and partner projects with sponsors. Furthermore, applications allow us to trim out a lot of the overhead found in most hackathons.

            <h5 class="question">What's with the name?</h5>
            <p class="answer">
              Pontifex means bridge builder. We want to work as hard as possible to build non-partisan products that can be used by all types of people. That being said, we recognize that in order to be effective, some products need to targeted in such a way that keeping the focus general and non-partisan is impractical. In these cases, we give precedence to projects helping marginalized peoples and communities.

            <h5 class="question">What kind of ideas are you looking for?</h5>
            <p class="answer">
              Anything that solves civic issues or improves civic engagement. A few possible categories are information access (ending echo chambers), town/city building, elections, workforce development, environment and sustainability, and education, but we are open to ideas. If you have an actionable way to target drug reform, water quality, or make entrepreneurship easier in rural areas, we'd love that too.

            <h5 class="question">I'm already working on a project, can I attend?</h5>
            <p class="answer">
              Yes, absolutely. Judging will be based primarily on potential impact and execution. We only ask that you disclose what you had done coming into the weekend. Feel free to mention your progress and any traction you have in your application.

            <h5 class="question">What does getting a sponsor for your project mean?</h5>
            <p class="answer">
              It is up to you! We'll work with you to set up arrangements with any companies or non-profits that are interested, keeping your team's interests in mind. Some teams may want to transfer ownership of the repo to their sponsor, while others may just get support and mentorship along with a few contributors from that company.

            <h5 class="question">Transportation? Laptops? Sleeping arrangements? Remote?</h5>
            <p class="answer">
              Unfortunately, the answer to all of the above questions is currently no. If you're interested in coming into NYC on your own, we'll do our best to try to find somewhere for you to sleep. We're open to remote teams, but require at least one person to be at the location for presentation purposes.

            <h5 class="question">Who can attend?</h5>
            <p class="answer">
              We're looking for professionals, as well as college and bootcamp students. Professionals can be organized into ad hoc teams or come directly from corporations - if your a company looking to send a team and produce an open source project, awesome! Student teams have the option of requesting dedicated mentors and will be judged separately. We're also hoping to partner with some incubators so that students can pursue these ideas further!

            <h5 class="question">What are the expected prizes?</h5>
            <p class="answer">
              We haven't yet secured what prizes will be, but the expectation is that most prizes will be tools and resources that allow you to continue building your product. Beyond that, we're looking for sponsors with fun ideas for prizes!
