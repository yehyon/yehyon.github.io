        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          Following the 2016 election, a huge number of engineers and technologists have expressed interest in using their skills to make a difference. While those intentions are good, many people don't have an outlet. Other groups have organized hackathons for social good, civic tech, and politics, but these hackathons have a critical flaw: the products don't live beyond the weekend. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Pontifex Project is building a hackathon that gives participants all the resources they need to bring their products into production. And because most civic tech products aren't viable businesses on their own, we're sourcing teams from and pairing teams with corporations and nonprofits that can provide support. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Projects built at a Pontifex Project hackathon should aim to be non-partisan and usable by as many communities as possible. They are also required to be open sourced, -- by staying open source, your product can find more collaborators, be forked by people with similar missions, and has a better chance of making a lasting impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pontifex Project's first NYC hackathon is aiming to have 20 teams of 4-6 people. All teams are required to submit an application, and ideas will be made available for comments and feedback to the public. Sign up for our mailing list to be notified when the application is available!
