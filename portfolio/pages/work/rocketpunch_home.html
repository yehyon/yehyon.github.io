There were many iterations which involved a design sprint failure, but through those trials and errors we were able to reach a final solution: a timeline formed by your professional network.

            The problem was obvious. Our users were barely using our homepage. Data showed that the typical user flow when someone lands on our homepage was to go straight to our secondary pages such as search pages or profiles.

            Despite our original intent of fostering content discovery, the home page was serving no functionality aside from being there for the sake of being there.

            These are quite unique problems specific to power users, but we learned through our user interviews that these were real problems that were causing much inconvenience. For instance, one of our avid users who was a sports broadcaster would post a question each morning and  would have his assistant manually count the comments and record the results on an excel sheet. Who would've thought people would be doing this in the 21st century...

        <p class="paragraph_content">
          Poptip Questions was Poptip's very first product as well as the very first product I ever designed. Thus, every single step was a valuable takeaway. However, in hindsight as an experienced product designer I see that it was a unique opportunity to work with dynamic data. Because the data flow was constant yet unpredictable it was very important to design for unforseen edge cases.

          Simplicity and clarity are the best ways to avoid mishappenings. Whether it be content or visual embelishment, Poptip Questions is the product that made me develop a habit of questioning myself whether an element is truely necessary, which also comes with the benifit of lowering engineering cost.
