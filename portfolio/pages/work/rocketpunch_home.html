          <p class="text-color-white font-weight-light paragraph_content">
            It was quite obvious that we had a problem. Our users were barely using our homepage. Data analytics showed that the typical user flow when someone lands on our homepage was to go straight to our secondary pages such as search or profiles pages .

          <div class="quote text-color-white padding_bottom_m">
            The home page was serving no functionality aside from being a mere placeholder.

        Why We Chose to Do a Design Sprint (That failed)</h2>
        <p class="paragraph_content">
          As mentioned in the overview, we embarked on a design sprint in early 2018 in which we failed to figure out our eventual final solution. We knew we had to redesign the homepage, but there was so much uncertainty. Since 2017, RocketPunch was transitioning from a recruitment platform to a business networking platform.

        </div>
        <p class="paragraph_content padding_top_l padding_bottom_m">
           Thus, as a team we decided that a design sprint would be the best method to redesign a homepage that aligns with our new identity. <b>The different stages of a design sprint forced us to face the difficult questions we were unable to answer.</b>

        <p class="paragraph_content">
          We weren’t able to nail the final solution in this sprint. Our goal was to design a key user flow that will help our users better understand the value and mission of our product: <b>creating professional connections through our platform.</b></p>

        <p class="paragraph_content padding_top_l">
          Our original solution was centered around the idea of customized content curation. <b>We wanted to motivate our users to connect with other users by curating a recommendation of people</b> they would most likely know or be interested in. Thus, we designed a homepage that functions as a task inbox where people would receive new sets of recommendations of people or content in their inbox each day.

          <div class="list">
            1. Seeing the existence of other users is <b>not enough to motivate users</b> to connect with one another

          <div class="list">  
            2. Static profiles do not indicate whether the following users are actually <b>active</b> on our platform

          <div class="list">
            3. Unless the users are active, there's <b>little motivation to connect</b> through our platform

          <div class="list">
            4. The content needed better indication as to <b>why they were being recommended</b>

          <div class="list">
            5. We needed a source of <b>validation for the content</b> we were recommending to our users
          </div>
          <p class="paragraph_content padding_top_m">
            From these takeaways, we realized that <b>we needed to shift our focus from content to people.</b> Good content is always important. However, the solution to motivating our users to connect with one another through our platform relied on the people on our platform. It was about how can we make our users feel the dynamic presence of one another.

          Poptip Questions was Poptip's very first product as well as the very first product I ever designed. Thus, every single step was a valuable takeaway. However, in hindsight as an experienced product designer I see that it was a unique opportunity to work with dynamic data. Because the data flow was constant yet unpredictable it was very important to design for unforseen edge cases.

          Simplicity and clarity are the best ways to avoid mishappenings. Whether it be content or visual embelishment, Poptip Questions is the product that made me develop a habit of questioning myself whether an element is truely necessary, which also comes with the benifit of lowering engineering cost.
