          <p class="text-color-white font-weight-light paragraph_content">
            It was quite obvious that we had a problem. Our users were barely using our homepage. Data analytics showed that the typical user flow when someone lands on our homepage was to go straight to our secondary pages such as search or profiles pages .
          </p>
          <div class="quote text-color-white padding_bottom_m">
            The home page was serving no functionality aside from being a mere placeholder.

          <p class="text-color-white font-weight-light paragraph_content">
             However, it took us many iterations and discussions to really understand why we weren’t able to nail a solid homepage that would bring value to our users.

        Why We Chose to Do a Design Sprint (That failed)</h2>
        <p class="paragraph_content">
          As mentioned in the overview, we embarked on a design sprint in early 2018 in which we failed to figure out our eventual final solution. We knew we had to redesign the homepage, but there was so much uncertainty. Since 2017, RocketPunch was transitioning from a recruitment platform to a business networking platform.

          Our original solution was centered around the idea of customized content curation. <b>We wanted to motivate our users to connect with other users by curating a recommendation of people</b> they would most likely know or be interested in.

            1. Seeing the existence of other users is <b>not enough to motivate users</b> to connect with one another

            5. We needed a source of <b>validation for the content</b> we were recommending to our users

            From these takeaways, we realized that <b>we needed to shift our focus from content to people.</b> Good content is always important. However, the solution to motivating our users to connect with one another through our platform relied on the people on our platform. It was about how can we make our users feel the dynamic presence of one another. Although we may not have been able to reach a final solution, we were able to identify the problem, set a clear goal on a solid path through our design sprint. Not it was time to start designing once again with what we’ve learned.

          There were several unique design challenges during this project due to the nature of a feed. A feed is where you see the preview of all different kinds of content that originally belong in other parts of the product. They’re already designed and displayed a certain way. Thus, in order to bring them into the feed, I had to go through each data type in our product and create an alternative design that would work with the card format we used for our feed.

          Poptip Questions was Poptip's very first product as well as the very first product I ever designed. Thus, every single step was a valuable takeaway. However, in hindsight as an experienced product designer I see that it was a unique opportunity to work with dynamic data. Because the data flow was constant yet unpredictable it was very important to design for unforseen edge cases.

          Simplicity and clarity are the best ways to avoid mishappenings. Whether it be content or visual embelishment, Poptip Questions is the product that made me develop a habit of questioning myself whether an element is truely necessary, which also comes with the benifit of lowering engineering cost.
