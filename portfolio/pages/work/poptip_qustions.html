              We want to know what people think. From the very beginning of Poptip there was a common theme, which was the desire to hear the crowd. Our first product: Questions, manifested that desire by creating a way for our users to ask a question across various social media platform and aggregate/share the crowd’s opinion.

          <p class="text-color-white font-weight-light paragraph_content">
            Despite the massive increase in twitter & facebook usage, the conversation remained one way. As a poster, sharing became easier than ever but there was no real effective way to listen to one’s audience.

            You can count likes and favorites, but once you get to comments it's a blackhole. Keeping up becomes impossible after a certain point.

        Target Users</h2>
        <p class="paragraph_content">
          Initially we started building our product for a wider target: anyone on Twitter or Facebook who wanted to ask a question and hear back from one’s audience. However, we quickly realized our core target users were social media power users. People and brands who have thousands and millions of followers.

          These were the users who had the strong desire to communicate with their audience, yet had the most difficulty in finding an effective way to listen to their audience due to the sheer number of reactions they receive.

            3. Lack of ways to filter or analyze crowd reactions

          <p class="paragraph_content padding_top_m">
            These are quite unique problems specific to power users, but we learned through our user interviews that these were real problems that were causing much inconvenience. For instance, one of our avid users who was a sports broadcaster would post a question each morning and  would have his assistant manually count the comments and record the results on an excel sheet. Who would've thought people would be doing this in the 21st century...

        <p class="paragraph_content">
          Poptip Questions was Poptip's very first product as well as the very first product I ever designed. Thus, every single step was a valuable takeaway. However, in hindsight as an experienced product designer I see that it was a unique opportunity to work with dynamic data. Because the data flow was constant yet unpredictable it was very important to design for unforseen edge cases.

        <p class="padding_top_l padding_bottom_m">
          Simplicity and clarity are the best ways to avoid mishappenings. Whether it be content or visual embelishment, Poptip Questions is the product that made me develop a habit of questioning myself whether an element is truely necessary, which also comes with the benifit of lowering engineering cost.
