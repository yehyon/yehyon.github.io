              People are curious to know what others think, and by the year 2012 there were many social media channels providing us with excellent online platforms for open discussions and chatter. Our goal was to utilize these platforms and create an easy way for our users to engage with their audience and gain insightful data points from their audience reactions.

          <p class="text-color-white font-weight-light paragraph_content">
            Twitter and Facebook made content sharing very easy but there was still the limitation of conversations remaining pretty much one way. Once the size of your audience goes beyond a certain number there was no real effective way to listen.

          <p class="text-color-white font-weight-light paragraph_content">
            A lot of what we see from brands is pushing content as a means to drive engagement. What that results in are things like retweets, likes and shares, all of which are valuable but missing out on the key engagement that can happen with social content: discussion.

          Initially we started building our product for a wider target: anyone on Twitter or Facebook who wanted to ask a question and hear back from one’s audience. However, after the initial trial period, it became quite obvious that our product synergized the best with social media power accounts. People and brands who have thousands and millions of followers.

            These are quite unique problems specific to power users, but we learned through our user interviews that these were real problems that were causing much inconvenience. For instance, one of our avid users who was a sports broadcaster would post a question each morning and  would have his assistant manually count the comments and record the results on an excel sheet. Who would've thought people would be doing this in the 21st century...

        <p class="paragraph_content">
          Poptip Questions was Poptip's very first product as well as the very first product I ever designed. Thus, every single step was a valuable takeaway. However, in hindsight as an experienced product designer I see that it was a unique opportunity to work with dynamic data. Because the data flow was constant yet unpredictable it was very important to design for unforseen edge cases.

          Simplicity and clarity are the best ways to avoid mishappenings. Whether it be content or visual embelishment, Poptip Questions is the product that made me develop a habit of questioning myself whether an element is truely necessary, which also comes with the benifit of lowering engineering cost.
